An MD-PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles, I am interested in the historical, social, economic, and scientific frameworks that have shaped modern medicine. Through mixed-methods historical research, I aim to provide perspective and context to medical professionals and health policymakers seeking to build compassionate practices and sustainable health systems.

In my spare time, I love to make art. My illustrations, photography, and designs have been featured in art festivals, published in magazines, and used across social media platforms. For more about my art, feel free to browse my portfolio!
