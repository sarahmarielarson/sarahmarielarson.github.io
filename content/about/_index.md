An MD-PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles, I am interested in the historical, social, economic, and scientific frameworks that have shaped modern medicine. Through mixed-methods historical research, I aim to provide perspective and context to medical professionals and health policymakers seeking to build compassionate practices and sustainable health systems. For more information about my background, please see my CV. 

In my spare time, I love to practice painting, illustration, and photography. For more about my artwork, feel free to browse my portfolio!
